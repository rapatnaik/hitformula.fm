      <h2>1.What have you done so far?</h2>
      <p>
        So far, we’ve built a webpage that lets users explore how different song features relate to popularity. The idea is to see if things like acousticness, energy, or danceability actually have any impact on whether a song becomes a hit. We created an interactive scatterplot using D3.js that updates based on the feature you choose from a dropdown. We also focused on making the page feel clean and easy to use, with some styling to make it look more like a modern music platform. On the backend, we cleaned the dataset and normalized the values so the plots would be readable and accurate. The graph is already working, and the data updates correctly when different features are selected. We also wrote the intro and headings to make the project feel approachable and music-focused. At this point, the basic structure of the site and its functionality are mostly done.

      <h2>2.What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and why?</h2>
      <p>
        I think the hardest part will be turning the scatterplots into more of a story, so that people don’t just see a wall of dots and leave. A lot of the relationships between features and popularity are weak or unclear, so we have to find smart ways to guide the viewer without forcing conclusions. It’s also going to be tricky to keep the graph readable across different devices — for example, some users might be on smaller screens or not familiar with musical terms. We’ll need to add explanations or tooltips to help with that. Another challenge is deciding how to highlight any patterns or outliers, like a super popular song with high acousticness, without cluttering the chart. We want the page to feel interactive but not overwhelming. Overall, finding the balance between simplicity, insight, and visual appeal is going to be the biggest design challenge.
